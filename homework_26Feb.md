### In class work:

Since we had time in class to work on our project, I and Ronit connected the frame with the stands to the bottom.
First we sawed the necessary pieces for both stands:

Secondly we connected the stands with the frame to the bootom with the screws. It is good that there were two of us, becuase one person held 
a stand with a frame and another used a drill and then screws to connect.

After connecting everything here is what we received. The conncetion seemed to be very strong.

Here is an overall view, how we plan it to look like in the future.

Next step: to find out the right degrees values for a proper movement of the frame.

Some decisions made in class:
- We will use aluminuim for our final look, so it means that I have to start working with metal.
- The motor will now be placed vertically instead.
- We will first work on the ride and then do the frame which will correspond in the size.

### Homework
