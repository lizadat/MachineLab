# Progress

We have made a lot of progress, which is looking like final steps, yaaay!!!
A lot of things has been done and here are the updates:

- We already had the button working, which was great. We just added all the clouds to the code and it worked perfectly.

- We decided to add the neopixels strip to the bottom to light up the city, so we soldered 4 neopixles, each consisting of 19 parts, but it was all one.
- We painted the city skyline, it turned out to be very detailed and looked like a real city!
- We also decided to use 2 Arduino, because 1. the giant servo motor was twitching and 2. we needed a lot of pins for music maker shield and clouds

- We attached the whole skyline and also the LED. Connected two Arduino and wrote the code for it.
