# Progress

### In class
Since we had some time during our class on Monday, we continued working on our front ride. We added the aluminium holder to hold the shaft and prevent it from leaning to the sides. We had to think a lot on how to attach it as precise as possible because its bending was not precise. But we managed to do it and here is a final look:

During the class on Wednesday we continued soldering the wires so that they are longer and can reach Arduino on the back. During the class we finished 4 clouds and connected the to the frame in a corresponding position. Moreover, we put the tags on each so that later on during wiring everything and coding each clouds separetely we will be able to figure out which cloud is where.

### Homework
After the classtime we finished all the clouds and attached them. We might change the heigh of each cloud later on, but currently it looks pretty well. Soldering and making all the clouds in general was quite a repetitive and not fun task to do, but it helped to practice my soldering skills. 
Before we had the 

Professor has helped to figure out the code for the cloud to fade. Previously we had an issue with delay, so we used the millis method as the result. 
I combined the code for the neopixel fading the the servo motor.

In the end everything worked out well. The motor and neopixel go together. Here is a video of it from two perspectives: side and front.

Problems we are facing:
We need to laser cut the cars, but the laser cutter in the lab broke. We reached out to the advanced workshop, so maybe they will be able to help us. 

Future steps: 
- We will add more clouds to the code and will connect them to the Arduino and use additional voltage for neopixel
- We will figure out how to laser cut the cars
- We will 3D print the holders for the cars
- We will start working on the design for a bottom of the ride. We want to laser cut the skylines of different cities to fill that space and craete an illusion that the ride is very high.
