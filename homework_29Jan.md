## The ideas for the themes for the clock
### - The time travel (from the ancient times to nowadays: ancient Egypt, First/Second Industrial revolution, 60s and 70s, modern world, future)
### - The future (we can each create a part how we emagine the world will be in a couple of years, something fantasy)
### - Parts of the world (As we are from different countries we can collaborate to recreate each continent of the earth) 

In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 5 possible topics to research for this course. Topics can include authors, inventors, artists, machines, projects, locations, etc. Write a sentence about why you feel this topic belongs, and provide at least one link to some further information about it. You do not need to commit to researching any one of these topics; you may pick something else, and someone else may pick one of yours

## Research topics

### A clock mechanism
The first research area that I though of is the mechanism of a clock. First of all it is because we are to work with a clock. Secondly, it is a super popular mechanism that we use every day, but never give a thought how it works, how does it run eternally without batteries, just winding? I really enjoy wearing the watches but I could not even imagine how complicated, precise and meticulous it is. This mechanism has a long story which dates back to the 17th century which started with a pendulum clock by a Dutch polymath. 
The example of how to build your own clock mechanism and for a better undertsanding of how it works can be found here. [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WCw0Flpqiw&ab_channel=MakingTricks).
