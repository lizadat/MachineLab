## The ideas for the themes for the clock
### - The time travel (from the ancient times to nowadays: ancient Egypt, First/Second Industrial revolution, 60s and 70s, modern world, future)
### - The future (we can each create a part how we imagine the world will be in a couple of years, some fantasy)
### - Parts of the world (As we are from different countries we can collaborate to recreate each continent of the earth) 

In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 5 possible topics to research for this course. Topics can include authors, inventors, artists, machines, projects, locations, etc. Write a sentence about why you feel this topic belongs, and provide at least one link to some further information about it. You do not need to commit to researching any one of these topics; you may pick something else, and someone else may pick one of yours

## Research topics

### A clock mechanism
The first research area that I though of is the mechanism of a clock. First of all it is because we are to work with a clock. Secondly, it is a super popular mechanism that we use every day, but never give a thought how it works, how does it run eternally without batteries, just winding? I really enjoy wearing the watches but I could not even imagine how complicated, precise and meticulous it is. This mechanism has a long story which dates back to the 17th century which started with a pendulum clock by a Dutch polymath. 
The example of how to build your own clock mechanism and for a better undertsanding of how it works can be found here. [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WCw0Flpqiw&ab_channel=MakingTricks).

### The NK Christmas Window Display
When I visited Stockholm, Sweden on Christmas I came across a mall, which had a fascinating window display. Obviously it was Christams themed and many people were standing there and watching, this was actually how I noticed there was something:). So it turned out that every window told a story about the same characters, but in different scenes. What made it interactive were the moving objects, characters. The movements were super simple, just rotating or goinf up and down, but it seemed like people really liked it. I think it has a clear connection to our class, because this is what we are planning to do. I think this project was amazing and it is something that we are planning to do, but in real life.
The video of the displays can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhDDSYT8NCY&t=282s&ab_channel=Travelandwalks). The display starts from 2nd minute.

### A flying robot penguin (aerial robot)
Again talking from my own experience. I was amazed by the flying robot penguin which I saw in the Museum of the Future in Dubai. When I first saw it I could not believe my eyes, it seemed to be unreal which invlolved a lot of physics. First is did not have any wires and even propellers, it was just floating on its own. It seemed to be smart, knowing where to go, how to not crash the walls or people. I think it will be interesting to look at in our class because I think there is a lot of things such as sensors, mechanisms hiding inside.
