# Sky Ride: Ideation
in collaboration with Ronit
For our clock project we landed on the 'Theme Park' theme!
In order to combine the natural aspect and the theme we came up with the idea to work on the Sky Ride!

## Inspiration
Here is our inspiration for the project!

## Rough Sketch
Our segment will include 3 main objects, 2 of which will be moving. 1 - the ride itself (will have the rotational movement of the roll on two stands which will have the syncronized rotational movement) , 2 - the clouds (they would separately go up and down), 3 - city/park on the bottom (will not move). Here is a sketch of how it might look like. It will be quite minimalistic because you are basically in the sky and there is not much of the stuff.

CLOUDS:
The clouds will be 3D, made of polyester stuffing with the LEDs (or Neopixels) light inside. They will be coming from the top, attached to the wire or something. Here is an image how it will look like:

- There will be around 5 clouds (3 on the back, 2 in front), different sizes.
- There will ne blue and white LEDs in each cloud.
- The clouds will be attached to the top, I would like them to move up and down or left and right

Things needed:
- Polyester stuffing
- Hot glue
- Blue and white LEDs
- Wires
- Moving mechanism

The challening part in here for me is the moving part. I would like the clouds to move either up and down or right and left. They can be attached to 2 sticks, which should alternatively move in different directions. I need to think on a mechanism to make it move.

30 mins later...

I came up with an idea how to make the clouds move!
I can use a Servo motor!
The clouds will be attached to two sticks which lay in parallel. Then those two sticks will be attached to another one which will be perpendicularly. This last one will be attached to the servo motor. The motor will rotate 180 degrees one way, making one parallel stick go up and one down, and then 180 degrees another way, making one do down and another do up. 
Here is a sketch of how it will look like:
