# PROGRESS

Unfortunately I did not have time during the break to work on our project, but I would like to document some changes and progress that we made.

## Class progress:
During the class on March 6th Ronit and I worked a lot on our project, specifically concentrating on our ride. 

Before that I would just like to mention how I solved my issue with a motor turning not smoothly, but going one degree at a time with pauses. After consulting with @michaelshiloh and reading the documentation or manuel for the Giant Servo motor I started experiementing with some extra features of the motor. As it appeares there are additional things I can change to control the movement of the motor. There are two of those: angle output range and sensitivity range. I tried changin the value first for the angle output range and what it did - it changed the range of the angle but not the movement itself, it still was not smooth. However the sensitivity range was just what I was looking for. I was able to control the smotheness of the movement and made it the way I wanted! Here is the screenshot of the manuel for the motor (the two values I was changing are on the top left)

### RIDE!
We decided to take lots of steps in practically putting the ride and attaching to our base. We attached the stands (unfortunately I am very bad at remembering the right words for all the details we used, but they are seen on the images) and the pulleys using very different ways, some of them very not reliable (expecilly the hot glue), but in the future we will make the accommodation for that. 
It took a while to fix the motor to the bottom since the 3D printing was not quite precise. We found a piece of acrylic to put under the motor to level everything and then with the help of screws attached everything to the bottom.

We experimented with the rope. First we tried the knitting one, but it is not reliable. We tried the fishing rode but it was hard to fix on the right length and was not what we wanted. Finlly we landed on the orange one which was provided by the professor. It was easy to adjust the length cause we melted the sides and could 'glue' them together.
