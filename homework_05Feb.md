# Project Themes
I really liked all the proposed ideas for our clock project! All of them seem to me very creative and doable. However, I was especially drawned by 2: nature and NYUAD journey.

## NYUAD journey
- This will be the topic that all the students can relate to; 
- There is a place for creativity, we can work collaboratively to think and reflect on our own experiences;
- If there are 4 parts it can be 4 years and each year is truly different (arrival, study away, capstone, stress etc);


## Nature


What would it depict?
What materials will you use for each part?
How would you animate anything moving?
Will there be sound? What?
Will there be lights? (We have lots of NeoPixels.)
Make a rough sketch, to the best of your ability.
What mechanical components will you need?
What electronic components will you need?
Draw a block diagram showing very roughly how these components are connected. You don't need to show the circuit or specific wires, just in general what is connected to what.
What tools or equipment or skills will you need?
Write this up in your Github repository, in a file named "homework_05Feb.md".
Remember to use MarkDown and format it properly.
Include any sketches or pictures (maybe inspiration, a look you're going for, or a mood board, etc.). Look in my lecture notes to see how to include images.
You can divide the report up into parts and each of you in your group can do one part. Make sure you address all the requirements above. In each of your parts provide a link to the other parts. Look in my lecture notes to see how to create links.
