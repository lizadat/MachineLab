# Progress

We have made a lot of progress, which is looking like final steps, yaaay!!!
A lot of things has been done and here are the updates:

- We already had the button working, which was great. We just added all the clouds to the code and it worked perfectly.

- We decided to add the neopixels strip to the bottom to light up the city, so we soldered 4 neopixles, each consisting of 19 parts, but it was all one.
- We painted the city skyline, it turned out to be very detailed and looked like a real city!
- We also decided to use 2 Arduino, because 1. the giant servo motor was twitching and 2. we needed a lot of pins for music maker shield and clouds

- We attached the whole skyline and also the LED. Connected two Arduino and wrote the code for it.

This is the final result:

- Last step: attached the Arduinos and the motor driver to the back for an easier transportation on Wednesday!

The only issue we have as of now, the time on two Arduino is running differently, so in the interval for each one should be twice smaller. For now we solved it by hardcoding. 

Things to finish up:
- code for the right interval for the show happening (how long it should run for)
- paint the left car
- paint the frame of the clouds and all the wires
- combine the audio files into 1
