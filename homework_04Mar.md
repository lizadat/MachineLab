# Project progress

### PROGRESS IN CLASS
Ronit 3D printed the car we plan to use for our sky ride. 
It was supposed to be easily assembled, however we faced an issues. The parts were supposed to be constructed together (similar to LEGO), but it did not work as printed parts, holes were not exactly the right size. So we ended up using a glue for plastic to put all the pieces together. It was pretty strong, the glue did good job, but it took us quite a long time in comparison to what it could be if the printing was the way it was supposed to be.

We also did a lot of planning in terms of all right measurements for our ride and frame for a final look. We faced a few issues, for example we had to make sure that the stand for a sky frame and the car do not touch each other, the car does not collide with a vertical plane on the back and so on. We could draw everything on our draft bottom, which helped a lot.

As a result here are some important measurements: the stands for a frame should be 75 cm high, this is where the frame will be attached. The size of a frame 43*34 (as far as I can remember) cm. @michaelshiloh helped us to cut the aluminium pieces the right length, so that the work is done better and faster.

Our plan for the future was:
- Cut the metal for the ride stands
- Create (assemble) the stands
- Make the pillar for the ride
- One more or two more clouds
- Decide on the rope (try out the fishing line 1 mm)


### PROGRESS AT HOME

WORKING WITH METAL
I was first quite scared about working with metal, cause drilling and everything looked much harder than with wood. However, as a result I enjoyed the process and learned how to do everything.

Just when I started figuring out where to drill the holes I had a dilemma. My plan was to drill the holes in the middle and on both sides, so that I would used one bolt to connect the angle brackets on both sides. However, the brackets I used had the holes in different places and even when I tried to connect them with one bolt, the brackets would appear tilted, so this method did not work.

I used a used metal pieces to figure out the right connection I wanted to use. I was advised to use a screw to connect the brackets and have 2 screews on each side. I thought they would obstruct one another, but surprisingly the did not, and it all was quite tight.

So I used this method for my initial metal part. I also marked all other spots for the holes for the frame and drilled. After that I connected the motor to one of my stands and I really liked how strong it was. I feel that motor is quite heavy and the stand, with two brackets on the opposite sides were not enough. What I did is that on the other stand the two brackets are not on the other sides as in the first stand, so they can support the motor from falling to the sides.

When I assembled the frame it was very loose. I do not know what might be the reason, but I have 2 ideas: 1 - I need to tight more the bolts and nuts; 2 - there are small pieces of metal left on the holes after drilling, so maybe I need to find a specific tool which can remove them.
