# Progress

## In class
The lecture in class was very helpful for understanding of how everything will look like in the end. Even though we are still in the process of developing our project, but it is good to have in mind what is coming next so we can cover some steps now (for instance making the wires longer so that they would reach Arduino and powering station on the back of the platform). 
We continued making progress on our SkyRide during the class.
First of all the 3D prints (two wheels) were completed so we replaced our old ones with the new. Since we had enough space on the wheels inside to attach the holders we drilled the filles for that. There was one mistake made though as we drilled one big hole for the shaft and we did not used it because the shaft is not supposed to go to the wheel. It is a good reminder for the future: Score (think) twice before you cut (drill) once. It does not harm our project except how it will look like in the end. 
Here are the photos from how we attached the wheels.

After we attached the new wheels we wanted to try out how everything worked. Howeve we realized that our motor has only one wire attached to it AND there is no access to the place where the wires are attached. As a result we had to unscrew our aluminium shaft holder and solder the wires to the motor. Then we attached it back to where it was supposed to be. 
We then connected the motor for the ride and servo for the clouds and made all the mechanisms moving! It actually works! 
Only thing we need to do is to make a rope for ride a bit longer, but we will see how the cars will impact it. 
And, speaking about the cars, we laser cut one, but the thickness of the material is very small, so we did uuse the glue to put it all together. The car turned out very light, which is both good and bad: good - it does not put any pressure on the rope; bad - it is floating and is the weight is not equally distributed. We want to get the ply wood and laser cut again and see how it will turn out. We will also need to think of how to attach it to the rope.
