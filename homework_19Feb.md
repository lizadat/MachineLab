# Proccess documentation

This weekend I continued working on my sky part for the skyride.
Here is what I have done:

1. I started with sawing the right size wood. I measured the length, width and height of our base for the clock and 
decided how long wood sticks should be to fit in.

3. I put the sticks together to see how it will look like and then attached them to each other with the screws.
The first screw did not go that well (cause I do not have a lot of experience with that), but the rest were pretty well.

4. In order to attach the rotational part of the motor to the frame I attached the special bracing to it also with the help
of the screws. I realized that my wood stick is quite narrow, so I could not attach it all around and used just 4
screws instead of 8.

5. Then I worked with two stands, one of which will hold the motor. I attached the metal holders to the top of one stand with the screws and used the 4M bolts to attach the motor

6. These are all components I worked with. They cannot be dissambled, so if I want to change something I would have to do everything again. When I attached the motor I realized that it became higher than it was supposed to be, so I ended up doing some more sawing of the stand, which hold the motor.

7. To try out I attached the motor and the frame to see how it will look like.
