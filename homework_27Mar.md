# Progress

## In class:
During the class on Wednesday we continued working on our project. We made our final decisions regarding 3D printing new details and laser cutting the cars. We hope to have it all done by the next class.

As planned, I completed the frame by adding two additional parts in the middle in order to add more clouds. I could easily do the tasks as I already had experience with drilling and fixxing the bolts properly.

The second part I worked on was the clouds. As suggested by the professor I replaced the solid wire to the stranded wire for a sake of strength. As the clouds will be hanged and the wires will not be fixed it is better to use this type of wire. Additionally they were flexible and as a result look better than the solid. 
I disassembled the old clouds and resoldered the wires. Also I created two more, so in total now I had 5 neopixel parts. I again used the plastic ties to make small bows as I liked how it looked like in the end.
