# Progress

## In class
The lecture in class was very helpful for understanding of how everything will look like in the end. Even though we are still in the process of developing our project, but it is good to have in mind what is coming next so we can cover some steps now (for instance making the wires longer so that they would reach Arduino and powering station on the back of the platform). 
We continued making progress on our SkyRide during the class.
First of all the 3D prints (two wheels) were completed so we replaced our old ones with the new. Since we had enough space on the wheels inside to attach the holders we drilled the filles for that. There was one mistake made though as we drilled one big hole for the shaft and we did not used it because the shaft is not supposed to go to the wheel. It is a good reminder for the future: Score (think) twice before you cut (drill) once. It does not harm our project except how it will look like in the end. 
Here are the photos from how we attached the wheels.
