# Project Themes
I really liked all the proposed ideas for our clock project! All of them seem to me very creative and doable. However, I was especially drawned by 2: nature and NYUAD journey.

## NYUAD journey
- This will be the topic that all the students can relate to; 
- There is a place for creativity, we can work collaboratively to think and reflect on our own experiences;
- If there are 4 parts it can be 4 years and each year is truly different (arrival, study away, capstone, stress etc);
I made small skecthes for each part with a description for each:

I think that the movement in this theme might be limited, however it really depends on what we come up with. 


## Nature
The nature theme was chosen by a lot of people and I personally like it as well.
I think it can inlcude 4 things, such as sun and sky, water, plants and trees, animals. These objects are quite 'movable' so it will be easy to come up with the ideas. 
Here are my sketches on this theme:

I would go into details for the first part (the sun and the sky):
- It will be a 3D project: the sun and the clouds will be 3D shaped (the clouds can be made of sintepon)
- There will be neopixels lights both in the clouds and sun: the clouds - different shades of blue; sun - we can make a gradient - bright yellow to orange (the colors will be changing). It will be bright and very cool with the lights.
- The movement will be rotational. We can build everything on one platform and make it slowly rotate. Or if more complicated, make the sun rotate one way and the clouds another.
- I think the sound is 100% but it should be one for the whole project (i think if we do one sound per each part it will be just a noise). If we focus on nature theme we can create an audio of the birds signing, the sound of leaves in the wind, the water etc.
Here is a small sketch:

To create such a rotational movement I would need a continious servo motor, for each object I would need some metal or wooden support to make it stable. 


- If talking about the water, we would need a water pump. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TipNigD283w&ab_channel=RusticKraftChannel) of how to make it.
- For the tree, it can be one tree, with the LEDs, 2D shaped, but also with a fast rotational movement, so that when it is rotated it will create a 3D shape. Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4GyYgfM1Ao&ab_channel=THEELECTRONICSADDA) of that. Or something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VaryR4MhOCA).
Here is a more detailed sketch for this part. It will have a similar idea as the first part with the sun and the sky. However, it will be 2D shape. The basic material would be a wooden or metal outline of the tree, where the LEDs will be attached. The wires can be either inside the tree, like on the sketch or inside the frame(outline), so the tree will be empty inside.
