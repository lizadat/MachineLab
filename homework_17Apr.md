# Progress

### In class
Since we had some time during our class on Monday, we continued working on our front ride. We added the aluminium holder to hold the shaft and prevent it from leaning to the sides. We had to think a lot on how to attach it as precise as possible because its bending was not precise. But we managed to do it and here is a final look:

During the class on Wednesday we continued soldering the wires so that they are longer and can reach Arduino on the back. During the class we finished 4 clouds and connected the to the frame in a corresponding position. Moreover, we put the tags on each so that later on during wiring everything and coding each clouds separetely we will be able to figure out which cloud is where.
