# Progress

## In class:
During the class on Wednesday we continued working on our project. We made our final decisions regarding 3D printing new details and laser cutting the cars. We hope to have it all done by the next class.

As planned, I completed the frame by adding two additional parts in the middle in order to add more clouds. I could easily do the tasks as I already had experience with drilling and fixxing the bolts properly.

The second part I worked on was the clouds. As suggested by the professor I replaced the solid wire to the stranded wire for a sake of strength. As the clouds will be hanged and the wires will not be fixed it is better to use this type of wire. Additionally they were flexible and as a result look better than the solid. 
I disassembled the old clouds and resoldered the wires. Also I created two more, so in total now I had 5 neopixel parts. I again used the plastic ties to make small bows as I liked how it looked like in the end. 
All the bows except one, have 20 neopixels, that one has 18. I decided that it is the best size, however later on I might decrease the amount.

## Homework:
As we had a clear plan of what to do next for our homework we started with replacing our whole project to a final platform, which also has a vertical back. We did all the necessary measurements and it was relatively easy to attach the stands in the right spots. 
It was a good move from our side as now we could clearly see all the heights and distances, which we could not see having just the bottom. 
We were glad to see that everything was properly measured and there were no undpredictable problems (I am talking specifically about the frame touching the back plane, there is just enough space for rotation)!

After placing everything we had we also decided on creating one more ride, which would be lower and stand closer to the viewer. We will start workign on it when we finish with our original one and everything works properly. 

After the replacement I continued working on the clouds. First of all I checked whether I did all the soldering right. All the neopixels worked properly. Interestingly, when I started putting the polyester stuffing on one of the neopixels I noticed that the black wire was disconnected which suggested that soldering was not great, so I resoldered that connection. I hope the problem like this will not appear again, cause if one soldering is not right, the whole cloud will not work in a way I want.

I continued with putting the polyester stuffing on each neopixel. I attached it with a hot glue, which worked pretty well and if needed can be unglued. I already have the steps of how to attach it to the neopixel, so hopefully when I cotninue doing more clouds it will be faster. 

In the end I temporarily attached the clouds to the frame. I tried to put them on different heights and that's how I want it to look like in the end. I noticed that there was still some space left, so that was when I understood I would more clouds (preferable 3 middle size and maybe a few tiny ones), because I want the sky to look epic.
